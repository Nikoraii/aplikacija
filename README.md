# UNI PROJECT - Forum
Built using PHP, AJAX, MySQL, and XAMPP. Requires Apache and MySQL to run.
You can register, log in, post a comment and delete a comment. When a comment is posted it's updated using AJAX. Admin uses **admin-login.php** for the admin page.
Admin can do everything normal a user can and can also add, delete and change users, menus, pages, roles as well as delete comments. As for the style, only vanilla
CSS and HTML were used. It's far from done, however backend works as intended.
